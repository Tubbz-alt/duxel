## Components
All files (.skp) are created with Sketchup, but I have also provided DXF (line NOT mesh) files for easy import into other CAD Software.

### Node sheet
We have been using 3/5 marine grade plywood. Therefore all of our designs assume 3/4in material.

The holes are used to hook in the ratchet straps needed to get the diagonal cross tension need to keep the structure together.

### Node
6 3/4in thick node sheets are required to assemble one node.

### Subfloor
2 3/4in thick subfloors with each 2 2x4 joists are required for one floor.

## Düxel
With 8 nodes and 12 4x4x8 lumber pieces one can put together a düxel.

You will need ratchet straps to get the diagonal cross tention that keeps the structure together. We used [these](http://www.cargoequipmentcorp.com/2-Inch-Ratchet-Straps-with-Wire-Hooks-p/57xx84x-12.htm) 14ft ones with a working load limit of 3,333lbs.

I single düxel requires about 8 straps depeding on how stiff you need the structure to be. Larger structures usually can do with less. We calculated 1.75 per node to estimate the amount for our structure.
