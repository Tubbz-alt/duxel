A nifty way to build modular multi story structures

All files (.skp) are created with Sketchup, but I have also provided DXF (line NOT mesh) files for easy import into other CAD Software.

## Node sheet
We have been using 3/5 marine grade plywood. Therefore all of our designs assume 3/4in material.

## Node
6 3/4in thick node sheets are required to assemble one node.

## Duxel
With 8 nodes and 12 4x4x8 lumber pieces one can put together a duxel
